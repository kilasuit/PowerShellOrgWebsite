From James Brundage






        1.

       

Add inline help - even you will forget what some of your scripts do


        2.

       

Always output objects, so you can use the full joy of PowerShell


        3.

       

Split your scripts up into many functions: The bigger the script, the harder to understand.


        4.

       

Always write functions, not parameterized scripts.  No one likes jumping around the file system.


        5.

       

Even if you know the command line, give .NET a try.  The .NET framework is your friend.

                      How to swap two (small) text files? Same as variables:





                      ${c:file1.txt},${c:file2.txt} = ${c:file2.txt},${c:file1.txt}





                      Works even in V1. 😉
