### Resources

  * Tobias from ScriptInternals has just started a PowerShell blog, you can find it on [PowerShellCommunity.org][7].  He intends to post often about how to use PowerShell Plus features.
  * Real quick mention for newbies: you must see these tutorials. 
      * [Essential PowerShell][8] by Kirk Munro (aka Poshoholic)
      * [Keith Hill][9] has his Effective PowerShell series which is also great.
      * [Mastering PowerShell in your Lunch Break][10] is another favorite.
  * New [PowerShell Training Videos][11] from ScriptingOutpost.com from Don Jones
  * Quest AD Cmdlets Beta 1.1 available

### Tips

  * We found a nice script on the blog post [PowerShell and Excel][12] (from the "[Powershell,Passion,Persistence and Pursuit][13]" blog).  This script reads a server list from a text file and collects IP configuration settings of each server and uses that data to populate an excel sheet.
  * Using SQL with Powershell 
      * PowerShell TFM
      * iSQL, sqlcmd, Invoke-Sqlcmd
      * Article: [PowerShell, XML, and SQL Server][14]
  * Hal wrote [an article][15] that explains how to automate the syncing of iTunes to your iPod, using PowerShell of course.
  * [Interesting article][16] that talks about working with Hyper-V virtual hard disks.  Some neat examples in there about passing text to console apps like diskpart.exe.

### One-Liner

  * $env:path.split(';') updated by John Cook

### Gotchas

  * The alias for Set-Content collides with sc.exe.  Workaround is to be sure to type sc-dot-exe.
  * There is no Remove-Alias cmdlet!  You can use the alias: PSProvider with "del" to get the job done.
  * Oisin Graham [has written about][17] a big gotcha with working with remoting and WinRM with computers which are not domain members.

### Give Away

  * As mentioned at the top of the show, we'll be announcing the winner of our Vista Ultimate giveaway next week.  If you want a chance at it, send us feedback about the show to powerscripting@gmail.com.

### Emails!

  * We got some GREAT feedback from a few listeners lately.  Some of whom were obviously motivated by the free copy of Vista, which is why we did it.  🙂
