                      - 

*invoke-vmscript, remoting into VMs*









#### 

*Questions:
 *







*meson : ## So what about a XenServer PowerShell book? 😉
 rfoust : ## what is the best way to get started with the vi toolkit - is there a "getting started" guide?*
 jeffculb-1 : ## Why aren't the release notes for the vitoolkit accessible from the download page







*palen : ## Is 1.5 developed with PoSh v2 in mind, or is it still largely targetted at v1?*








*rfoust : ## are there any limitations in this version or is all of the api stuff available through cmdlets?*








*bsonposh : ## make vmotion easier*








*jon_medd : ## can Carter tell us about the new command that lets you run powershell code into vm guests?*








*rfoust : ## does vmware provide an opsmgr mp? if not, why?
 *







*meson : ## Does the toolkit allow you to manage DPM?*








*jeffculb-1 : ## Will there be more videos upcoming demonstrating new commandlets*








*meson : ## Any chance of allowing V2 remoting through VMWare?*








*Pasdargent : ## When running one of these scripts into the VM, does it show the shell on the VM server or is it completely "behind the scenes" to anyone on that box?*








*Pasdargent : This is probably too newbie a question but is the remoting traffic secure?*







                      *glnsize : ## does the explosion of powershell in vmworld, and it's presence at the virtual congress surprise you?*





                      *glnsize : ## why must i include host credentials the guest i get but if im auth through VC*






*Pasdargent : ## Will it pass throough your logged on credentials or do you HAVE to send creds?*








*Jaykul : ## So, is there a way to Invoke-VMScript from, say, 'nix?*








*Jaykul : ## And, do you get results back? (sync? async?)
 *







*meson : ## Is there anything that any PowerShell toolkits can't do?*








*bmichel7150 : ## Is it possible to pipe in multiple text files as variables, i.e., 1 text file with VM names and 2 text files with username and password, kind of like arrays in PS?
 *







*jon_medd : ## what's it like being a product manager for a windows based product in a company that doesn't always have the most friendly relationship with microsoft?
 *







*glnsize : ## do you oversee all the toolkits?
 *







*Pasdargent : ## Aside from PowerShell installed on your guest OS, what else has to be installed or opened to use invoke command?*







                      *A) Needs 3.5 U2 or higher*






*meson : ## can you interact with the host or VMFS partitions within POwerSHell
 *






                      *meson : ## Can I get rid of the VC Client is a good way to ask the question.*






*palen : ## Have any of the new cmdlets in v1.5 originate from the VI Toolkit community extensions?*








*bmichel7150 : ## Can the VI Toolkit talk into the ESX services themselves, I.E, a script to restart mgmt-vmware service?*








*jon_medd : ## will hal update his book for 1.5? i know he is not very busy 🙂*







                      *glnsize : ## what corner of the API are you looking at next, or at this point is it all fit and finish*






*jeffculb-1 : ## is version specific info referenced in the help for the commandlets*








*glnsize : ## what does the release cycle for the toolkit look like only major revs, or will you release as you go?
 *







*aleksandar : ## could carter say something about his experience with running ThinApped PowerShell?
 *







*Pasdargent : ## Are there plans to monetize the VI Toolkit or are you determined for this to be free indefinitely?*
