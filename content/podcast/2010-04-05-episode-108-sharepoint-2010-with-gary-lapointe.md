PowerWF is a Visual PowerShell development tool allowing users to build PowerShell scripts as workflows, which are similar to a flowchart or Visio diagram.  Once created, workflows can be deployed as applications, run as a scheduled task, or back to PowerShell as a script.  You can even push data to System Center with the click of a button.

Listener John sent this one in:

> _I got one! (he yelled through tears while pounding his fist on the floor)  After being so good to me and so reasonable about its idiosyncracies, PowerShell has hung it to me good on this one._  
> _  
>_  
> _Here's what I was after.  I wanted to format my IP addresses I was iterating through so that I could later sort the collection and have it sort correctly.  I used string formating to take the pieces of the address and concatenate it with periods and wound up with this:_  
> _010.001.001.001_  
> _Before doing the wmi query I had in mind, I wanted to make sure the system was up and not have to wait on the wmi timeout so I had something like this:_  
> _if (test-connection prettyip($_) -count 1 -quiet) {go do other stuff}_  
> _  
>_  
> _The prettyip thing came late in the day just so I could further analyze the data and when I put it in, everything stopped.  The test-connection test sat and sat before finally giving up and then my script went on with its fail routine even though I knew these machines were up._  
> _  
>_  
> _I'm going to let you go try test-connection or ping (that's all I've tested so far) and you're going to find that it tries to ping 8.1.1.1  It's converting the ip to octal.  It has something to do with the leading 0 (and the number being otherwise acceptable in base 8).  060.001.001.001 will ping 48.1.1.1_  
> _It isn't hard to work around, but WHO, honestly, expects this behavior?!  If you have (as I did) a mix of 10.x.x.x and 198.216.24.x (our public range) IP's, it will make you think you've lost it._  
> _test-connection 198.216.24.104 works and 198.216.024.104 doesn't._  
> _I can see how it's happening (or think I can) just as 0x0e is hex, 010 CAN be interpreted as octal but should it be?  Really?_  
> _  
>_  
> _It took me lots longer to figure this out than I'd like.  I had about 4 red herrings flopping around on the editor and though I didn't cry, it's only because I'm just too manly and pirate-like.  Otherwise...  I'da been sobbing._  
> _  
>_  
> _So...  There you go, fellers.  It got me.  Don't let it get you._
