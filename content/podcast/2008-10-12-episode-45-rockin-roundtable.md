      *What can you really do with PowerShell?  With Admin Script Editor the question becomes what ****can't**** you do with PowerShell?  Besides all the advanced code generating tools this is the only tool offering a true PowerShell Forms Designer.  To illustrate what can be done the guys at iTripoli created a full-featured MP3/Podcast player written entirely in PowerShell and delivered as a single script.  Check it out at *[*adminscripteditor.com/player*](http://adminscripteditor.com/player)*.*

[Bulking Importing User from CSV file using Quest cmdlets](http://turbochargead.org/articles/index.php/2008/10/bulking-importing-user-from-csv-file-using-quest-cmdlets/#more-85)

            Gotcha





            From Stephen Campbell:




## 







Open a cmd prompt on a Win2003 server and type the following:




            > 

> 
mkdir c:test1

> 

> 
> 

> 
net share test1=c:test1 /grant:everyone,full

> 







Now type the name commands in Powershell





            > 

> 
new-item c:test2 -type directory

> 

> 
> 

> 
net share test2=c:test2 /grant:everyone,full

> 







When I do the net share command in Powershell, the /Grant returns a syntax error.  Until I remembered about the comma!!  The following works great.





            > 

> 


> 
> 

> 
net share test2=c:test2 /grant:everyone`,full
