            finked: ## what was your first scripting language?


          - 
            palen: ## Did you spend much time on performance in the parser, or was that largely v1 kind of stuff?


          - 
            glnsize: ## as a comment... I don't write anything without implementing cmdlet bindings


          - 
            glnsize: ## ahhh there's cut and paste and your not typing this stuff at the console... keeping the parameters the same as c# allows me to easily translate code


          - 
            finked: ## what other areas might get performance boosts in the future?


          - 
            glnsize: ## what happened to runspaces, in ctp2 i could use runspaces... v2 switched to jobs and now I can't run scriptblocks locally in seperate runspaces.  rather i don't think i can...


          - 
            palen: ## Wait, an API for the PowerShell tokenizer?
