### Resources

  * There is now an [online reference][6] for the Quest AD Cmdlets- Thanks Dmitry
  * Video on [edge.technet.com][7] about PowerShell and Exchange with Desmond Lee

### Tips

  * Jeffrey Snover [reminds us][8] to update your GAC!  This really speeds up the start time for a powershell console.
  * [Enabling WinRM with Powershell / Get-Powershell][9] - Don't forget you can use Configure-WSman.ps1 to configure WinRM using PowerShell.
  * you can get a much faster file count of a directory by doing a get-item on the parent folder and calling the getFiles() method. Thanks Jaykul! 
      * measure-command {  
        $folder = get-item '\servershare'  
        Write-Host ($folder.getfiles()).count} # 524 Milliseconds  
        Measure-Command {(gci '\servershare').count} # 1min 18 sec
      * note that getfiles() will not count any directories

### Cmdlet-of-the-Week

  * out-host has a -Paging parameter

#### Gotcha

  * [Vista Event Logs and PowerShell][10] - Ben Pearce points out that you can NOT use Get-EventLog to access all the new logs that are in Vista.
