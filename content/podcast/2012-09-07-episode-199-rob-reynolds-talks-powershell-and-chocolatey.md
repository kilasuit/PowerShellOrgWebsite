  [22:22:16]  http://chocolatey.org/


  [22:23:34]  http://nuget.org/


  [22:24:32]  a Visual Studio extension that makes it easy to install and update third-party libraries and tools


  [22:26:20]  [http://docs.castleproject.org/](http://docs.castleproject.org/)


  [22:26:41]  [http://docs.castleproject.org/Windsor.MainPage.ashx](http://docs.castleproject.org/Windsor.MainPage.ashx)


  [22:31:24]  http://www.myget.org/


  [22:32:07]  paste the command from the site into your CMD prompt


  [23:10:48] 
 Kick the bucket == A common theory is that the idiom comes from a method of execution such as hanging, or perhaps suicide, in the Middle Ages.[3] A noose is tied around the neck while standing on an overturned bucket. When the pail is kicked away, the victim is hanged.


  [23:50:50]  so I'm still checking out this Chocolatey stuff...just to clarify it goes out and finds the bits to install, then silent installs for me?


  [23:51:01]  yep


  [23:51:09]  best example is just to do it


  [23:51:32]  @powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('http://bit.ly/psChocInstall'))" && SET PATH=%PATH%;%systemdrive%chocolateybin


  [23:51:43]  in a command line


  [23:51:47]  followed by


  [23:51:59]  it's a powershell module that it installs?


  [23:52:15]  cinst 7zip.commandline


  [23:52:31]  chocolatey is a collection of powershell modules


  [23:52:37]  but they don't end up in your profile at all


  [23:52:47]  where do they go?


  [23:52:48]  because in the end chocolatey is a command line application


  [23:52:58]  oh


  [23:53:03]  chocolatey.cmd ends up on the path


  [23:53:06]  so does it get installed to add/remove programs?


  [23:53:10]  nope


  [23:53:28]  it works (darn it, should have mentioned this) in low privilege environments


  [23:53:33]  not that I would want to, but how would you uninstall?


  [23:53:48]  delete the folder


  [23:53:54]  oh


  [23:53:57]  and update the path reference
