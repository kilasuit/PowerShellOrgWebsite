_Do you have the muscle to bring home the prize? Check out the details_ [_here_][6]_._ 

  * Don Jones gives a great illustration of [how the pipeline works][7] in this month's TechNet Magazine
  * Jon Noble points us out to [Updated PowerShell resources from TechNet Script Center][8] 
      * Two of the more comprehensive resources on Script Center have just been updated, the [PowerShell Owner's Manual][9] and the [Vbscript to PowerShell conversion guide][10].
  * And Jaykul from HuddledMasses.org has posted [part two of the powershell profile article][11] we mentioned last week.
  * Oisin brings us a script that will [resolve all Aliases in a script][12]. Uses CTP2 tokenizer

### Tips 

  * Variable expansion in strings. We've talked about it before, but I saw someone fighting with it just yesterday. 
      * "$object.parameter something else" does not work. Use "$($object.parameter) something else" instead
  * From Poshoholic: [Essential PowerShell: Name your custom object types][13] 
      * One important thing that is often overlooked when people are writing scripts that do this is that they can also give those objects a type name.
  * Sepeck on the #PowerShell IRC channel (irc.freenode.net) shared a link with us [about his experiences with PowerShell help files][14].  It's a good before-and-after story with a lesson.  :)  He links to one of [Don Jones' articles][15] with further advice on the topic.

### One-Liner

  * [system.directoryservices.activedirectory.domain]::GetCurrentDomain().DomainControllers | fl Name
