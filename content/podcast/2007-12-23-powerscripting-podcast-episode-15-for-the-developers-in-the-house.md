### Tips

  * Discussion on an email from listener John Cook:

> "I'm a programmer, so I don't find PowerShell (or VBScript etc.) difficult as a language. What I find difficult about scripting is scripting itself, such as recognizing when it's worth the effort to write a script. I'm a big fan of scripting, but I don't write a lot of scripts because I don't think to do it. Or I'm doing something that's not repetitive enough to script.  
> I would find it interesting to listen to a show about scripting strategy: organizing tasks so they can be scripted, etc.  
> I would also find it interesting to hear a discussion about testing scripts. I'm a fan of test-driven development, but scripts are hard to test. Scripts are full of side effects: creating or deleting files, setting properties, sending email, etc."

  * Discussion with Joel about his new Windows Automation Snapin for PowerShell (WASP) 
      * Blog post: [http://huddledmasses.org/window-gui-automation-from-powershell/][9]
      * New Codeplex project: [http://codeplex.com/WASP][10]
      * This is basically an upgrade to the [Win32.Windows snapin][11] Joel released a while back, the one thing that"™s missing in this release that was possible in that one is using frame-set definitions to position windows. That will make it back in eventually, but in the meantime, I present some major new additions which add up to the ability to do 90% of what you"™d want to do in testing or automating your winforms app"™s UI.
  * Also covered: Joel's experiences developing a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) PowerShell host.
