### News

  * PowerShell + [is now free][2] for non-commercial use!
  * [PowerShell TFM (2nd Edition)][3]to be available soon - May be available already from the Sapien site 
      * Don says Sapien tends to run some insane deals on New Years Eve so it may be worth watching out for that
  * [PowerShell Virtual User Group meeting #2][4] was Dec 4th - This was the second virtual event.  Speakers were: Don Jones (MVP), Dmitry Sotnikov (MVP), Oisin Grehan and Jeffrey Snover (Microsoft).  Recording is supposed to be available, but as of this moment, Hal can't find a darn thing about it.  Watch [Marco's blog][5] and [PowerShellCommunity.org][6].

### Resources

  * Jeffery Snover [interview at IT Forum][7] (video from PodTech)
  * [Admin Script Editor][8]from ITripoli 
      * Hal and Jonathan currently evaluating--looks extremely cool.
  * [PowerGUI][9] - [Version 1.0.12 released][10], now includes a debugger and more.  Don't forget the [known issues and patch][11] to work with the CTP.
  * [SpecOps Command][12]- use Group Policy to deploy and manage PowerShell scripts 
      * Can deploy PowerShell itself using GPO--as well as your favorite snapins!
      * Includes new [cmdlets][13]
      * All operations that you can perform from the administrative user interfaces you can perform from PowerShell.

### Cmdlet of the week

  * New-Object 
      * Creates an instance of a .Net or COM object.
      * Examples:


`new-object -comobject InternetExplorer.Application
 new-object -comobject "Shell.Application"
`* Also see Appendix E of the new book [Windows PowerShell Cookbook][14]

### Tips

  * Discussion of Hal's blog post: [Solving Problems with PowerShell: Simple Benchmarking][15]
  * You can access mySQL databases from Powershell using .NET.  Check out [Get-MySQLDataSet.][16] 
      * Oops--due to a clerical error, we forgot to cover this topic on the show!  We'll get it next time, Kemis!

### One-liners


`[system.Windows.Forms.MessageBox]::show("Hi mom")
`Gotchas

  * [Win32_Service.Change() method][17]and weird WMI stuff 
      * Rfoust@ #PowerShell was looking for a way to change the service password on remote machines.  There's a change() method but it's paremeters are really odd.  A vbscript example I found shows something like change(,,,,,,,"password") but it doesn't work in PowerShell.  Instead you have to insert $nulls and separate them by commas like so:  
        $rc=$svc.Change($Null,$Null,$Null,$Null,$Null,$Null,$Null,)
      * Solution by Jeffrey Hicks on the PowerShell.com forum thread ["Using WMI and/or Get-Service / Set-Service to modify service properties"][18]
      * Why doesn't just changing the properties, which are read-write (as you can see using get-member) do the trick?  We may never know.  :(  (That's a quip designed to inspire a listener to chime in with the answer.)

Thanks again to all of you listeners out there!  Your feedback makes it all worthwhile, keep that rolling in.  Our email address is
